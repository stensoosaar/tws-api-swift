	 A sell trailing stop order sets the stop price at a fixed amount below the market price with an attached "trailing" amount. As the market price rises, the stop price rises by the trail amount, but if the stock price falls, the stop loss price doesn't change, and a market order is submitted when the stop price is hit. This technique is designed to allow an investor to specify a limit on the maximum possible loss, without setting a limit on the maximum possible gain. "Buy" trailing stop orders are the mirror image of sell trailing stop orders, and are most appropriate for use in falling markets.

	 ```Swift
	 let order = Order()
	 order.action = .BUY
	 order.type = .TRAIL
	 order.totalQuantity = 100
	 order.trailingPercent = 0.25
	 order.trailingStopPrice = 200.00

	 - Note: Trailing Stop orders can have the trailing amount specified as a percent, as in the example below, or as an absolute amount which is specified in the auxPrice field.

	/**
	 A trailing stop limit order is designed to allow an investor to specify a limit on the maximum possible loss, without setting a limit on the maximum possible gain.
	 
	 A SELL trailing stop limit moves with the market price, and continually recalculates the stop trigger price at a fixed amount below the market price, based on the user-defined "trailing" amount. The limit order price is also continually recalculated based on the limit offset. As the market price rises, both the stop price and the limit price rise by the trail amount and limit offset respectively, but if the stock price falls, the stop price remains unchanged, and when the stop price is hit a limit order is submitted at the last calculated limit price.
	 
	 A BUY trailing stop limit order is the mirror image of a sell trailing stop limit, and is generally used in falling markets.

	 ```Swift
	 let order = Order()
	 order.action = .BUY
	 order.type = .TRAIL
	 order.totalQuantity = 100
	 order.trailingPercent = 0.25
	 order.trailingStopPrice = 200.00

	 Trailing Stop Limit orders can be sent with the trailing amount specified as an absolute amount, as in the example below, or as a percentage, specified in the trailingPercent field.

	 - important:
	 the 'limit offset' field is set by default in the TWS/IBG settings in v963+. This setting either needs to be changed in the Order Presets, the default value accepted, or the limit price offset sent from the API as in the example below. Not both the 'limit price' and 'limit price offset' fields can be set in TRAIL LIMIT orders.
